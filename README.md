# Sales Dashboard (Power BI)
**About the Project**  
This is a Sales Dashboard I built in Power BI to explore how sales, profit, and quantity change across different products, payment modes, and time.
It‚Äôs basically my way of making raw sales data look less boring and more ‚Äúyo, this actually tells a story.‚Äù

**What You‚Äôll Find Inside**  

Overall Summary:  
Net Sales: 438K  
Quantity Sold: 5615  
Total Profit: 37K  

**Profit by Sub-Category:**  
See which products are printing money (spoiler: it‚Äôs literally printers üòÇ)  
**Profit by Payment Mode:**  
Visual breakdown of which payment options make the most profit ‚Äî COD, UPI, Debit, Credit, and EMI.  
**Profit by Category:**  
Comparing profit across Clothing, Electronics, and Furniture.  
**Quantity by Month:**  
Monthly sales trend ‚Äî helps spot good vs meh months.  
**Quantity by Payment Mode:**  
Who‚Äôs paying how, and how often.  
**Count of States by Quantity:**  
See where sales are popping across states.  

# Tools & Tech  
Tool	Why I Used It  
Power BI	For building interactive visuals and dashboards  
Excel / CSV	As the raw data source  

# Dataset Details  
The dataset includes columns like:  
Order ID  
Category / Sub-Category  
Payment Mode  
Quantity  
Sales  
Profit  
State  
Month  
Basically, everything needed to understand what sells, how, and where.  

# Insights:  
Printers and Bookcases are profit beasts  .
COD dominates as the payment mode (apparently, people still love cash).  
Clothing and Electronics lead in overall profit.  
Sales bounce around month to month ‚Äî some months clearly do better.
